Procedure for Doing Fragstats Analyses for "Scale-dependent Responses to Habitat Configuration and Fragmentation in White-tailed Deer":

1. Open a new file.
2. Add the clipped raster file with the "add layer..." button under Input layers -> Batch management.
3. Add class descriptors with the "browse" button under Input layers -> Common tables -> Class Descriptors.
	a. Choose the "nlcd_2021_reclass.fcd" file. The other fcd will be used later.
4. Choose "Use 4 cell neighborhood rule" under Analysis parameters -> General options.
5. Choose "Total Edge (TE)" under Class metrics -> Area - Edge.
6. Choose "User provided points" under Analysis parameters -> Sampling strategy -> Partial sampling.
	a. Check "Class metrics" in this area.
	b. Check "Points table" in this area if not already checked.
	c. Click "..." next to Points table and choose your fpt file.
7. Check "Square with a side length of XXX.XX meters" under Analysis parameters -> Sampling strategy -> Partial sampling -> User Provided points.
	a. Click "..." next to "Square with a side length of XXX.XX meters" and set the side length to the first extent you chose.
	b. Run the model with the "Run" button.
	c. Click results then "Save run as..."
	c. Save run with a unique file name ending in number the edge length of your scale. Ex: FragFile_630 for an extent of 630 meters.
	d. Repeat step 7 with all extents.

DONE: You will now have a set of files for each metric measured at different extents. Files will all have the .class file extension.
